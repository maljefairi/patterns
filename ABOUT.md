- Analyze different types of thinking patterns
- Generate and vectorize linguistic patterns
- Study cognitive approaches in various topics
- Create structured datasets for pattern analysis

The system is designed to help understand how we think about complex topics and how different thinking patterns emerge across various domains of knowledge.
